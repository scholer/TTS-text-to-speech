# TextToSpeech, install message:

Congratulations - TextToSpeech plugin is now installed!

To speak text from within Sublime Text using TextToSpeech:

1. Open a file and select some text.
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to bring up the command pallet.
3. Type **`TTS: Speak`** and select the entry from the list.
4. You should now hear the selected text being spoken.
	If no text was selected, the complete file will be used.
5. You can additionally use
	* **`TTS: Pause`** to pause the speech synthesis,
	* **`TTS: Resume`** to resume,
	* **`TTS: Skip`** to skip to the next sentence, and
	* **`TTS: Skip **all` to skip all remaining text and stop text-to-speech synthesis.
6. If something goes wrong and the TTS engine starts misbehaving, you can use
	`TTS: Reinitialize` to reset the TTS engine.


If you would like to review the TextToSpeech usage instructions at a later time,
just select `Preferences -> Package Settings -> TextToSpeech -> README` from the menu.

The instructions also provide details on how to configure your Sublime Text "key bindings"
so you can start/pause/resume/skip/stop TTS using keyboard shortcuts.
